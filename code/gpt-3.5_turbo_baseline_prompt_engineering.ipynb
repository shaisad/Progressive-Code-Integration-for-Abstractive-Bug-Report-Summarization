Also it is not clear that the export can only do html files. The first time I ran export I triped to save as .jpg and it created a html file named foo.jpg Steps to reproduce: 1. In gnuCash go on reports and create any report that contains a graph 2. In the report window click on Export 3. Save export to \\\\\\\"foo.html\\\\\\\" Actual results: An empty HTML file is saved Expected results: A HTML file with a nice graph Does this happen every time? Yes Other information: Date: '2005-03-01 09:55:26' From: 'Christian Stimming ' Yes, that's true -- the current graphing code, which uses the graphical library \\\\\\\"Guppi\\\\\\\" which is a dead project, can only produce the on-screen diagrams *and* print these to postscript, but it cannot export these diagrams into pictures that are embedded in a HTML-file. In other words, you can only print the diagrams to postscript but not export them to HTML. This is not going to change before the gnome2 port is completed, because we need to switch to a different graphical library before anything related to this can be changed. See http://gnomesupport.org/wiki/index.php/GnuCashPortingStatus for the porting status. Date: '2006-02-24 01:03:38' From: 'Josh Sled' Definitely keep it as a reminder. We should be able to coax anything into giving us a PNG; GOG supports SVG export, too. But it looks like gtkhtml doesn't support saving &lt;object /&gt; data. Because it sucks ass. Date: '2007-01-03 11:46:11' From: 'Fred Blaise' This is still valid for me with version 2.0.4 on opensuse 10.2. This is a real problem not to be able to export these reports. This shouldn't be tagged 'enhancement' anymore, but brought up higher. What's the status on this? Thank you. Date: '2007-01-03 15:24:29' From: 'Josh Sled' (In reply to comment #4) &gt; This is still valid for me with version 2.0.4 on opensuse 10.2. &gt; This is a real &gt; problem not to be able to export these reports. &gt; This shouldn't be tagged 'enhancement' anymore, but brought up higher. &gt; What's the status on this? There's no change on this. I wonder if the more recent gtkhtml supports getting at &lt;object /&gt;s, or if the more recent GOG makes it trivial to create a PNG. In any case, I hesitate to do so, but I've raised the severity to Normal -- a minor part of the component (Reports, export, graphs) does not work. (FWIW, Fred, it's not going to get fixed any faster at Normal than at Enhancement.) Date: '2007-08-08 00:49:35' From: 'datakid' I can confirm this using GnuCash 2.0.5 on Ubuntu 7.04, feisty fawn...and I can confirm that it's frustrating.... Date: '2009-01-01 15:06:33' From: 'Beto Zamora' 2.2.8, still doesn't have this needed feature... Frustration also confirmed. Date: '2009-04-26 19:37:33' From: 'Phil Longstaff' GtkHtml provides a callback when it encounters a &lt;object&gt; tag, and gnc-html then calls gog to create the image as a GdkPixbuf and then embed it in the web page. For the webkit port, there is no &lt;object&gt; callback. Therefore, gnc-html-webkit pre-parses the html string, finds the &lt;object&gt; tag, calls gog with the parameter values from the &lt;object&gt; to create a GdkPixbuf, then converts the pixels to png/base64 and embeds the html &lt;img&gt; in the original where the &lt;object&gt; was. Result is a graph that displays in webkit. In addition, gnc-html-webkit saves the html passed to webkit and handles the export itself by writing that html to a file. This fix is targetted for 2.4. I can also convert gnc-html-gtkhtml to use these two features (convert graph to embedded &lt;img&gt; and do the export rather than getting gtkhtml to do it) for those who can't build 2.4 with webkit. Date: '2009-06-20 22:59:59' From: 'Phil Longstaff' It turns out that gtkhtml (at least the version I have on Ubuntu 9.04) doesn't support inline images. Therefore, this will only be possible using webkit. Date: '2005-11-15 14:19:15' From: 'Christian Stimming ' The gnucash-1.8.x series is no longer developed.

Could be handy to have it appear and desappear onmouseover. thanks Date: '2009-03-28 14:53:55' From: 'Dan Meltzer' The real solution is to make it not cover applets, not make it appear/disappear on mouse over. Date: '2009-03-29 14:34:53' From: 'Leo Franchi' i dont understand your point, dan... how do we make it not cover applets? Date: '2009-03-29 16:32:22' From: 'Dan Meltzer' Thats your problem to solve :) The toolbar should be like the panel in kde, it gets it's own area to draw in (a strut in window manager terms). The applets should not consider the space the toolbar takes up to be theirs to play in, but rather end at the top of it. Date: '2009-03-29 17:26:09' From: 'Leo Franchi' well if i move a window on my desktop down, the panel does cover it. so i still don't understand... Date: '2009-03-29 18:19:23' From: 'Dan Meltzer' right, but new windows placed on the desktop do not get placed under the panel, and maximizing windows doesn't put them under the panel either. You need to explicitely place the window under the panel, and I considder it a bug that it's possible (but that's not what this debate is about).] The panel should not obfuscate applets by default. Date: '2009-03-29 18:53:15' From: 'Mark Kretschmann' I fully agree with Dan here, and I also fully admit that I don't have the slightest clue on how to implement this technically :) But I really think that what he wrote makes a lot of sense, if feasible.

Date: '2009-03-29 19:50:43' From: 'Dan Meltzer' The applet should end where the toolbar begins. Applets should not be larger than the viewable area, if there's an applet above it, then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint, and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen) Basically, no applet should continue on off the screen, it should end at the panel. Date: '2009-03-29 19:58:27' From: 'Leo Franchi' i disagree :) what you are describing is a very different use-case of the CV in general, and distinctly different from what the original idea that was developed. in fact, i think there is another bug where we've already had this discussion (with mark), and this has come up on IRC. anyway, this is not something to be fixed, but rather a change that needs to be discussed with people like e.g. leinir. regardless of all of this, the problem of \\\\\\\"applets falling off the end of the screen\\\\\\\" should be mitigated when we are able to resize applets. Date: '2009-03-29 20:48:48' From: 'Dan Meltzer' You can't tell me that the screenshot attached to this bug is intended. There is no way to see the final line or two in the lyrics applet. This is a major bug. Date: '2009-03-30 17:30:19' From: 'Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen' The bug that is being shown here is the fact that you cannot yet resize your applets, and as such we also don't set default sizes sanely. You are reporting a bug on a non-completed feature ;) Date: '2009-03-30 19:10:07' From: 'mangus' infact it was a wish! ;-) Date: '2009-03-30 20:04:58' From: 'Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen' Of course :) Just thought i should point out that the feature is not yet completed - the polish that's gone into it \\u00d9\\u2026ately could seem like an indication of feature completion, and as such it would seem the prudent course to inform you \\u00d9\\u0081hat that is not the case :) Date: '2009-03-31 00:33:48' From: 'Dan Meltzer' I don't think that this should be dependent on being able to resize freely at all... Most of the time, the sizegrip for resizing ends up in the bottom right corner, and as such, would be inaccessable reguardless of whether it was free sizing or not. The bug isn't that the applet can't be made smaller, but that part of the applet is completely inaccesible. Date: '2009-03-31 15:56:48' From: 'Kevin Funk' I fully agree with Dan aswell. I don't understand the confusion as it doesnt matter at all if an applet is resizable or not. To quote Dan: \\\\\\\"The applet should end where the toolbar begins. Applets should not be larger than the viewable area, if there's an applet above it, then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint, and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen)\\\\\\\" That's the expected behaviour and what is used in the playlist aswell.

I downloaded the source of amarok 1.94, and compiled it with gcc 4.2.3 Fix boolean logic which caused the progress info to be shown when overwriting tracks during a collection copy.\",\n          \"When I try to export reports that contain graphs gnuCash just creates an empty html file. Also it is not clear that the export can only do html files. The first time I ran export I triped to save as .jpg and it created a html file named foo.jpg Yes, that's true -- the current graphing code, which uses the graphical library \\\\\\\"Guppi\\\\\\\" which is a dead project, can only produce the on-screen diagrams *and* print these to postscript, but it cannot export these diagrams into pictures that are embedded in a HTML-file. In other words, you can only print the diagrams to postscript but not export them to HTML. This is not going to change before the gnome2 port is completed, because we need to switch to a different graphical library before anything related to this can be changed. We should be able to coax anything into giving us a PNG; GOG supports SVG export, too. This shouldn't be tagged 'enhancement' anymore, but brought up higher. &gt; This is a real &gt; problem not to be able to export these reports. It turns out that gtkhtml (at least the version I have on Ubuntu 9.04) doesn't support inline images. The gnucash-1.8.x series is no longer developed. We may keep this enhancement request as a reminder, though.\",\n          \"In amarok2-svn I like the the new contextview , but I found the new bottom bar for managing applets annoying , as it covers parts of other applets sometimes , like lyrics one , so that you miss a part of it. The real solution is to make it not cover applets, not make it appear/disappear on mouse over. The toolbar should be like the panel in kde, it gets it's own area to draw in (a strut in window manager terms). The applet should end where the toolbar begins. Applets should not be larger than the viewable area, if there's an applet above it, then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint, and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen) Basically, no applet should continue on off the screen, it should end at the panel. You are reporting a bug on a non-completed feature ;) Of course :) Just thought i should point out that the feature is not yet completed - the polish that's gone into it \\u00d9\\u2026ately could seem like an indication of feature completion, and as such it would seem the prudent course to inform you \\u00d9\\u0081hat that is not the case :) will be fixed in 2.1.1, done locally.
